Recreating a google search page using HTML and CSS

This project is a part of <a href="http://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.

This is a simple, visual representation of a Google search, with many normal
functionalities being omitted, as it isn't in the scope of this exercise.

Some buttons, or inconsequential icons have also been excluded from the markup as well.
